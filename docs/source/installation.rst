============

SRW package consists of a C++ library and client libraries for:

- C
- Python
- Igor PRO

Linux/macOS Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the SRW root folder run::

  $ make all

This command will build the needed dependencies, the main SRW library and also the Python library to be used.

To build SRW with OpenMP support use::

  $ MODE=omp make all


After this step is concluded, you can use the Python library by adding the `python` folder to your `PYTHONPATH` variable
or install the `srwpy` package at your Python distribution via the `setup.py` file.
